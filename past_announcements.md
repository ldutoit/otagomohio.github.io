From Ngoni Faya, Training Coordinator for Genomics Aotearoa:

    Learning how to use HPCs can be tricky! To make the process more enjoyable, come along to NeSI hacky hour, Wednesday July 10th from     1:00-2:00pm, where NeSI users can share their difficulties, exchange ideas, and get help from their peers and NeSI staff.   

    The topics of discussion are up to you :-) So if any questions or comments come to mind (could be about slurm, profiling, or anything else), please pop them into this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFTY_M4Y6iGOWFDnwoqRSYCAw7Gx8vr3kqPRYgZZcfc/edit?usp=sharing) beforehand (it would make us super excited!)
